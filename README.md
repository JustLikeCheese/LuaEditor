# Lua Editor

This project is for publishing LuaEditor to Maven.

The editor module's source code are from [AndroLua_pro](https://github.com/nirenr/AndroLua_pro)

We recommend you using SoraEditor instead of LuaEditor, as LuaEditor has many design flaws.

## Maven

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.justlikecheese.editor:LuaEditor:1.0.0'
}
```

## Thanks

If without nirenr open source release, the AndroLua community wouldn't exist today.
